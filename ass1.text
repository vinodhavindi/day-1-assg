        Online learning involves courses offered by postsecondary institutions that are 100% virtual, excluding massively open online courses (MOOCs). Online learning, or virtual classes offered over the internet, is contrasted with traditional courses taken in a brick-and-mortar school building. It is the newest development in distance education that began in the mid-1990s with the spread of the internet and the World Wide Web. Learner experience is typically asynchronous, but may also incorporate synchronous elements. The vast majority of institutions utilize a Learning Management System for the administration of online courses.

        Given the improvements in delivery methods, online learning environments provide a greater degree of flexibility than traditional classroom settings.[16][17] Online platforms can also offer more diverse representations of student populations as learners prepare for working in the twenty-first century.[18] The diversity comes from interacting with students outside of one's geographical location, possibly offering a variety of perspectives on course content.[18] Courses offered completely online are primarily delivered in an asynchronous learning or synchronous learning format.
